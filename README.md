#### Report date Aug-25-2023

*  An introduction to what is a rise up program, what is git, what is the logic in programming, and the programming basis for making software.For materials 'Get Started with Programming Fundamentals to Become a Software Developer', maybe I will explain a little. This material discusses the basics of programming and continues with designing the application you want to make.
Today I studied math for machine learning:<br>
    * Systems of Linear Equations<br>
    * Matrices<br>
For matrices I just learned two things:<br>
    * About matrices multiplication and<br>
    * What is the Identity Matrix.<br>
Because discussing machine learning, of course the language used is Python. And here I learned some basic Python, Python is known as a programming language with the shortest syntax. Python is used because there are many libraries that are very helpful in machine learning

* For second weekly report,There is a lot materials and assignment.For materials,There is 3 core <br>
    * Using python to interact with the Operating System (literally interact with OS,in this case we use Linux)<br>
    * Crash course on python (learn about advanced python like substring,regex,etc)<br>
    * Introduction to Git and GIthub (How to manage your files locally and web server with github,we learn the basic command like pull,add,push,clone)<br><br>
Today i learned :<br>
    * Data Stream<br>
Data stream can sending or receiving data without using callbacks.Data stream also process data piece by piece.So, using data stream can reduce our resources(memory) and it's better than load all data(it takes so much memory),the program will work easily or fast with minimum resource.The resources can used to another process.If you want build a program in real time acces or have a big data or have minimum resource, i suggest you to use data stream<br>
    * Python Subprocess<br>
Sub process in python mean that you can start new process or run new code.If you want to build an Automation,you can use Python Subprocess Module.Of course not only automation you can do,there is a lot things that you can do with sub process module.Because i am focusing the Machine Learning path,so i think i will use the Subprocess module to do Automation.
    * Error Handling<br>
Same like other programming language,error handling in Python use 'Try and Except block',you write all codes in try and except in order to catch the error

Third week,i have larned about 'Data',there is 3 core in this week:<br>
   * Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere                  (This we learn how all data interact with us in daily life)
   * Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions   (This,we start to learn how to use data we have collected)
   * Prepare Data For Exploration                     (This,we learn about data type,manage data,filter,organized,and many other)

Today i have learned about :<br>
* Data ethic and privacy
Talk about data,of course not all adata we can publish or process,there is a lot of data ethic and privacy.<br>
I will take anonymization as example.We want our data is safe when company collect our data,so,what is anonymization?<br>
Anonymization can eliminate/create initial.We often use anonymization at: Name,Telephone numbers,License plat and Etc <br>
   * Transformation data(Change structure data)
   * Structured data (Have same types,usually created in rows and coloumns)
   * Unstructured data (Different types)
   * Wide data (By multiple  coloumns) and Long data (By multiple rows)

#### Report date Sep-15-2023
* This week, we have learned 3 cores:
   * Process Data from Dirty to Clean         (How to do data cleaning, what thing we should clean dat)<br>
   * Analyze Data to Answer Questions      (We learned queries, data formatting, data transform, etc)<br>
   * Share Data Through the Art of Visualization (We learn how to make data  easy to understand to other people like stakeholders,client,etc)
<br><br>
Now I will explain a little bit more about 3 thing about <br>
Process Data from Dirty to clean.<br>
Why data must clean? We know even we have normalized a data, it is still not cleaned such duplicate ,missing data.So we must clean data to make sure the data valid.<br>
Analyze Data to Answer Questions<br>
In case we have a question, how many people using this product, we can use data from database like sql or excell, then enter the condition to get output<br>
Share Data Through the Art of Visualization<br>
Just like the word saying, we create visualization (graph, pie, etc) with a rule, in order to help other people what data is it, what is the biggest value, etc<br>

#### Report date Sep-22-2023
Period 11-15 September 2023 , i have learned about little bit about R programming language.<br>
R programming language is like other programming language, but R programming more into statistic thing.<br>
* R programming also have many advantages are:<br>
   * Open source <br>
   * Data manipulation, data visualization, and statistics packages <br>
   * Has many library you can use<br>
Now, lets talk about Data structures at R programming language. Data structures at R programming language are List and Vector.<br>
How we create a vector at R?<br>
Use 'c(value1, value2, value 3)' . If the value is a number, you must add 'L' in each number, example c(1,9,10) To---> c(1L,9L,10L)<br>
How we create a list at R?<br>
Not much different from create a vector, just replace 'c()' function to 'list()' function.<br>

#### Report date Sep-29-2023
In this week, i have learned Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization. So, at this topic, I think i will explain a little bit about Linear Algebra <br>for Machine Learning and Data Science. Well, it's not much different with math at your previous class. There are 4 cores at this course but i will explain one.<br>
- System of linear equation. As we know, there are two types System of linear equation. First one is System of linear equation 2 variables, and second one is System of <br>linear equation 3 variables. Of course all of them have matrices too, we know how to solve at math, but at this course teach us how we solve this problem at programming <br>
#### Report date Oct-06-2023
In this week, i have learned about calculus, probability and  statistics. <br>
* At calculus we learn<br>
   * Derivatives and optimization (More advanced derivatives like euler number, logarithm natural)<br>
   * Gradient and gradients descent (gradient descent will used to train machine learning model with neural network)<br>
   * Optimization in neural networks and newton's method (talk about classification, and regression)<br>
I will explain a little bit about the word 'Classification'<br>
Classification divide two types. First one is Binary Classification (Only 2 output like yes / no, woman/man, and other). And another one is Multi classification ( More than 2 output like weather prediction sunny/rain/cloudy/storm and  other)<br>
* At probability and statistics we learn
   * Probability theorem (naive bayes, bernouli)
   * Sampling (Mean, variance, point estimation)
   * Hypothesis  testing
#### Report date Oct-13-2023
* In this week i have learn 3 cores of course are:<br>
   * Introduction to Machine learning (Talk about learning types in machine learning like supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning)<br>
   * Regression (Talk regression with multiple input variables, linear and logistic regression)<br>
   * Classification (how to solve use classification)<br>
I have explained about first core, so i will explain a little bit about the other cores.<br>
Regression<br>
There are 2 regression. First one is  linear regression (Used to estimate) and logistic regression (Just like classification). And there is multiple input variables as i know It evaluates the relative effect of variables on the dependent variable when holding all the other variables in the model constant.<br>
Classification<br>
There are 2 types, first is binary class (only 2 output like yes or no/man or women/ dog or cat, etc) and the other one is multi class (more than 2 output)<br>

### Report Date Nov-17-2023
In this week, i have learned about a more advanced in machine learning. The topics are :<br>
Unsupervised Learning (The short meaning is how we can train unlabeled data)<br>
Recommenders             (How to build a system recommender)<br>
Reinforcement Learning (machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and punishing undesired ones)<br>

I will explain a little bit more (based on coursera)<br>
Unsupervised learning<br>
This course focus on clustering and anomaly detection. Clustering is process unlabeled data to create a group. Anomaly detection itself is the outlier in data, we can find anomaly with several algorithm like gaussian<br>
Recommenders <br>
Recommenders focus on filtering.<br>
Reinforcement learning<br>
This method is very often used to machine learning, the key is correct algorithm<br>

### Report Date Nov-24-2023
For this week, i have learned<br>
-Deep Learning<br>
-Convolutional Neural Network<br><br>

I will explain all point above<br>
Deep learning<br>
Deep learning is part of machine learning. Deep learning has a structure called ANN ( Artificial Neural Network) . ANN itself has 2 or more hidden layers to process the data and get the output. Computer vision also part of deep learning. I will explain a little bit about object detection. Object detection will scan object with 'square' shape, and detect inside. Most used real time detection is YOLO algorithm<br>
Convolutional Neural Network<br>
The most used in convolutional neural network are convolutional and pooling. Convolutional is get the 'abstract/core' in image, when pooling resize the image.<br>
