#### Report date Aug-25-2023

*  An introduction to what is a rise up program, what is git, what is the logic in programming, and the programming basis for making software.For materials 'Get Started with Programming Fundamentals to Become a Software Developer', maybe I will explain a little. This material discusses the basics of programming and continues with designing the application you want to make.
Today I studied math for machine learning:<br>
    * Systems of Linear Equations<br>
    * Matrices<br>
For matrices I just learned two things:<br>
    * About matrices multiplication and<br>
    * What is the Identity Matrix.<br>
Because discussing machine learning, of course the language used is Python. And here I learned some basic Python, Python is known as a programming language with the shortest syntax. Python is used because there are many libraries that are very helpful in machine learning

* For second weekly report,There is a lot materials and assignment.For materials,There is 3 core <br>
    * Using python to interact with the Operating System (literally interact with OS,in this case we use Linux)<br>
    * Crash course on python (learn about advanced python like substring,regex,etc)<br>
    * Introduction to Git and GIthub (How to manage your files locally and web server with github,we learn the basic command like pull,add,push,clone)<br><br>
Today i learned :<br>
    * Data Stream<br>
Data stream can sending or receiving data without using callbacks.Data stream also process data piece by piece.So, using data stream can reduce our resources(memory) and it's better than load all data(it takes so much memory),the program will work easily or fast with minimum resource.The resources can used to another process.If you want build a program in real time acces or have a big data or have minimum resource, i suggest you to use data stream<br>
    * Python Subprocess<br>
Sub process in python mean that you can start new process or run new code.If you want to build an Automation,you can use Python Subprocess Module.Of course not only automation you can do,there is a lot things that you can do with sub process module.Because i am focusing the Machine Learning path,so i think i will use the Subprocess module to do Automation.
    * Error Handling<br>
Same like other programming language,error handling in Python use 'Try and Except block',you write all codes in try and except in order to catch the error

Third week,i have larned about 'Data',there is 3 core in this week:<br>
   * Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere                  (This we learn how all data interact with us in daily life)
   * Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions   (This,we start to learn how to use data we have collected)
   * Prepare Data For Exploration                     (This,we learn about data type,manage data,filter,organized,and many other)

Today i have learned about :<br>
* Data ethic and privacy
Talk about data,of course not all adata we can publish or process,there is a lot of data ethic and privacy.<br>
I will take anonymization as example.We want our data is safe when company collect our data,so,what is anonymization?<br>
Anonymization can eliminate/create initial.We often use anonymization at: Name,Telephone numbers,License plat and Etc <br>
   * Transformation data(Change structure data)
   * Structured data (Have same types,usually created in rows and coloumns)
   * Unstructured data (Different types)
   * Wide data (By multiple  coloumns) and Long data (By multiple rows)

#### Report date Sep-15-2023
* This week, we have learned 3 cores:
   * Process Data from Dirty to Clean         (How to do data cleaning, what thing we should clean dat)<br>
   * Analyze Data to Answer Questions      (We learned queries, data formatting, data transform, etc)<br>
   * Share Data Through the Art of Visualization (We learn how to make data  easy to understand to other people like stakeholders,client,etc)
<br><br>
Now I will explain a little bit more about 3 thing about <br>
Process Data from Dirty to clean.<br>
Why data must clean? We know even we have normalized a data, it is still not cleaned such duplicate ,missing data.So we must clean data to make sure the data valid.<br>
Analyze Data to Answer Questions<br>
In case we have a question, how many people using this product, we can use data from database like sql or excell, then enter the condition to get output<br>
Share Data Through the Art of Visualization<br>
Just like the word saying, we create visualization (graph, pie, etc) with a rule, in order to help other people what data is it, what is the biggest value, etc<br>
