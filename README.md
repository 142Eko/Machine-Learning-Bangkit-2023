An introduction to what is a rise up program, what is git, what is the logic in programming, and the programming basis for making software.For materials 'Get Started with Programming Fundamentals to Become a Software Developer', maybe I will explain a little.

Today I studied math for machine learning:<br>
-Systems of Linear Equations<br>

For matrices I just learned two things:<br>
-About matrices multiplication and<br>
-What is the Identity Matrix.<br>
Because discussing machine learning, of course the language used is Python. And here I learned some basic Python, Python is known as a programming language with the shortest syntax. Python is used because there are many libraries that are very helpful in machine learning
